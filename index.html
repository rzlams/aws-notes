            AWS PowerShell as if you are working in a machine<br />
            <br />
            <b>IAM Roles</b><br />
            They are used to assign permissions to AWS services in order to perform action on your behalf. A role can be used by either an IAM user in
            the same AWS account as the role or a user in a different AWS account. A role can also be used by a web service that AWS offers; a prime
            example is Amazon EC2.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Identities</b> <br />
            They are the IAM resource objects that are used to identify and group. You can attach a policy to an IAM identity. These include users,

            docker like images to be run in EC2 instances. The AMI must be in the same region as that of the EC2 instance to be launched. If the AMI
            exists in a different region, you can copy that AMI to the region where you want to launch the EC2 instance. The region of AMI has no
            bearing on the performance of the EC2 instance.<br />

            <b>AWS Budget</b><br />
            Allows you to set a limit to your bill<br />
            You can set alarms via email, based on (budget) thresholds of your current or forecasted cost<br />
            You can also set actions when the thresholds are exceeded <br />
            You can create the following types of budget:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating a cost budget</li>
              <li>Creating a usage budget</li>

            <b>EC2 instance types</b><br />
            - General porpuse: ideal for web servers. Good balance between compute, memory and networking.<br />
            - Compute optimized: great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors.<br />
            - Memory optimized: fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Security groups</b><br />
            - It is (kind of) a firewall that can be attached to any EC2 instance.<br />
            - It controls how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances. Can only contain ALLOW rules.<br />
            - You can attach several security groups to an EC2 instance.<br />
            - By default a security group deny any inbound traffick and allow any outbound traffic.<br />
            <br />
            <b>EC2 Purchasing options/Launch types</b><br />
            <b>- On-Demand: </b> pay as you go<br />
            <b>- Reserved: </b> (up to 70% discount) you commit to use the instance for one or three years with no, partial or all upfront payment:
            <ul>
              <li>Standard: you cannot change the type of instance</li>
              <li>Convertible: you can change the type of instance</li>
              <li>
                Scheduled: you reserved only a specific period of the day, week or month. This is not a valid response on the exam. AWS currently has
                this messages in its web: "You cannot purchase Scheduled Reserved Instances at this time".
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>- Spot: </b> the most cost-efficient (up to 90% discount). They use available resources of other instances thus they can be destroyed
            without prior notification.<br />
            <b>- Dedicated Instance: </b>hardware dedicated to your use but you don't have control over instance placement.<br />
            <b>- Dedicated Host: </b>fisical server fully dedicated to your use. You need to commit for a 3 years period. Any question that talks
            about special licensing requirements refers to this instance type.<br />

            - Is a recommended storage option when you run databases on an instance <br />
            - Can be attached to only one EC2 instance at a time but one instance can have several EBS volumes attached<br />
            - Only work in one availability zone. You can create a snapshot to migrate a volume from one AC to another<br />
            - Amazon EBS Snapshots are a point in time copy of your block data. For the first snapshot of a volume, Amazon EBS saves a full copy of
            your data to Amazon S3. EBS Snapshots are stored incrementally, which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored. <br />
            <br />

            - You can create a new AMI from an existing EC2 instance.<br />
            - EC2 Image Builder. Is a free service that help you to attach packages, roles and config other options to create a custom AMI.<br />
            <br />
            <b>EC2 Instance Store</b><br />
            - Is a high performance block storage attached to an EC2 instance. Is ephemeral, is deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated.<br />
            <br />
            <b>EFS - Elastic File System</b><br />
            - Is an elastic file system for Linux-based workloads <br />
            - Can be mounted in hundreds of EC2 instances even if they belong to multiple AZs.<br />
            - Can be directly used with on-premises systems. <br />
            - Offers high availability, scalability but at a higher cost. EC2 instances can access files on an EFS file system across many
            Availability Zones, Regions and VPCs<br />
            - The Infrequent Access storage class is cost-optimized for files accessed less frequently. Data stored on the Infrequent Access storage
            class costs less than Standard and you will pay a fee each time you read from or write to a file. <br />
            <br />
            <b>FSx</b><br />
            - FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable Windows native shared file system.<br />
            - FSx for Lustre (Linux and Cluster) is a fully managed high peformance, scalable file storage for High Performance Computing (HPC). It

              <li>Network load balancer (ultra high performance, allows for TCP) - layer 4</li>
              <li>Classic load balancer (slowly retiring) - layer 4 & 7</li>
            </ul>
            - During the ELB config process you can:
            <ul>
              <li>Make the ALB available in different subnetworks (ACs)</li>
              <li>Attach security groups</li>

            <br />
            <b>Auto Scaling Groups - ASG</b><br />
            - You can set a minimum, maximum and desired size and the ASG scales accordingly<br />
            - The goal is to setup as many EC2 instances as you set in the desired size without breaking the minimum and maximum sizes (limits)<br />
            - It can replace an unhealthy instance and register new instances to a load balancer<br />
            - Scaling Strategies:<br />
            <ul>
              <li>Manual Scaling: manually set the ideal sizes</li>

                <b>- Simple / Step Scaling: </b> set alarms in CloudWatch and when the alarm is triggered then add or remove instances. <br />
                <b>- Target tracking scaling: </b> tracks a metric. For example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%. <br />
                <b>- Scheduled scaling: </b> anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns. For example: Increase the min capacity at 5pm on

            an IP address. <br />
            - The buckets are private by default. You need you make it publicly accesible attaching it a policy (that can be created with the Policy
            Generator). <br />
            - Bucket policies allow you to control access to entire buckets, whereas access control lists let you control access to individual objects
            within an S3 bucket. <br />
            - The objects has some limits: max size of 5TB. Must be a "multi-part upload" if uploading more than 5GB <br />
            - S3 versioning: allows you to maintain a history of the files stored in S3, so you can rollback any unintended change. Any file that is
            not versioned prior to enabling versionnig will have version "null". <br />
            - S3 server access logging: this option of S3 store logs of the activity of one bucket in another (server access logging). <br />
            - S3 cross / same region replication (CRR/SRR): must give proper IAM permissions and enable versioning in order to use this S3 feature. It
            basically replicates the data from one S3 bucket into another bucket that can even be in a different account. It's worth mentioning that
            files that already exist in the bucket before enabling the replication aren't going to be copied to the new bucket.<br /><br />

            agent on EC2 and make sure IAM permissions are correct. It can also be used in your on-premise infrastructure. <br />
            <b>- CloudWatch / EventBridge events: </b> with CloudWatch events you can trigger an event to activate other services like Lambda, SNS or
            SQS. It can be configured to dispatch the event on time basis to work like a cron job. EventBridge is an event bus that can trigger its
            own custom events or receive and enroute events from other sources. The model event schema for EventBridge is defined in the Schema
            Resgistry.
            <br />
            <b>- CloudTrail: </b> is a per region service that helps to log the API calls in your AWS account (event history) for as long as 90 days.
            CloudTrail delivers log files within 15 minutes of account activity. It registers at least the username of the author of the action and
            the region that the request was made to. With CloudTrail, you can create a trail that either applies to one Region or to all Regions. To
            persist events for a longer time you have to sent them to an S3 bucket and then query it with Athena. It shows you the info of the events
            in the CloudTrail console but also can send it to an S3 bucket or create an EventBridge event. By default, the log files delivered by
            CloudTrail to your S3 bucket are encrypted using server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). There are three
            types of CloudTrail events:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Management events: operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. CloudTrail log this events by default. Also, it can
                separete read and write events.
              </li>
              <li>Data events: this kind of events are not logged by default because high volume operations.</li>
              <li>
                CloudTrail insights: enable it to detect unusual activity in your account. It analyzes normal managements events to cerate a baseline
                and then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns. Anomalies appears in the CloudTrail console or could be sent
                to an S3 bucket. Also, an EventBridge event is generated for autmation porpuses.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>- X-Ray: </b> is intended to help with the visual analysis of applications. Is the right tool to understand the dependencies in a
            microservice architecture because it also allows you to pinpoint service issues and troubleshoot performance (even users that are
            impacted). <br />
            <b>- CodeGuru: </b> ML powered service to automate code reviews and application performance recommendations. It provides two
            functionalities:

          <td>
            <b>- Virtual Private Cloud - VPC: </b> it can come across multiple AZs and also can be devided in several public/private subnets. When you
            define a VPC you need to set the CIDR Range that is the pool of IPs that is going to use the VPC. <br />
            <b>- Internet Gateways: </b> helps our VPC instances connect to the internet. A public subnet has a route to the internet gateway in order
            to reach the internet. <br />
            <b>- NAT gateways: </b> is a managed service that allow your instances in your private subnets to access the internet while remainning
            private. It acts as a bridge between the instance in the private subnet and the internet gateway. Another option to do this is by setting
            up a NAT instance, which would be a NAT service managed by yourself. <br />
            <b>- Network Access Control List - NACL: </b> it is a firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet and are attached at a subnet
            level (rules only apply to IP addresses). It can have ALLOW and DENY rules. It's a stateless service, meaning you need to set rules for
            inbound and outbound traffic. <br />
            <b>- Security Group: </b> it is a built-in firewall that controls traffic to and from an EC2 instance. Rules includes IP addresses and
            other security groups. Can have only ALLOW rules. It's a stateful service, meaning you only need to set rules for inbound traffic and it
            allows outbound traffic for the same request.<br />
            <b>- VPC Flows Logs: </b> It captures information about IP traffic going into your interfaces (VPC, subnets, load balancers, ElastiCache,
            RDS, etc) helping to monitor and troubleshoot connectivity issues. VPC Flow Logs data can go to an S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs. <br />
            <b>- VPC Peering: </b> it allows you to connect two VPC privately using AWS's network, making them behave like if they were in the same
            network. VPC peering connection is not transitive (must be stablished for each VPC that need to communicate with one another). Must not
            have overlapping CIDR. <br />
            <b>- VPC endpoints: </b> allows you to connect to services using a private network instead of the public www network, this gives you
            enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services. There are two kind of endpoints:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Endpoint Gateway</b> for S3 and DynamoDB only.</li>
              <li><b>Endpoint Interface</b> for the rest of the services. <br /></li>
            </ul>
            <b>- Transit Gateway: </b> allows you to establish a connection between thousands of VPCs on one single gateway. It works with Direct
            Connect and AWS VPCs. <br />
            <b>- Virtual Private gateway:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>- Site to site VPN: </b> connect an on-premise VPN to AWS. The connection is automatically encrypted because it goes over the
                public internet, but has the advantages that is easy to setup. Customer Gateway and Virtual Private Gateway (see attached image) are
                needed to establih the connection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>- Direct Connect (DX): </b> establish a physical connection between on-premise an AWS. The connection is secure and fast because it
                goes over a private network, but takes at least one month to be established.

            <b>CONCEPTS</b> <br />
            <b>- AWS Free Tier: </b> offers some services for free for the first 12 months after signing up for an AWS account. It also offers free
            short-term trials of selected AWS services.
            <b>- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): </b>
            Is the cost to buy something plus the cost to operate it over its useful life. The idea is to take into consideration the total cost that
            a business will incur to operate an asset (in this case, run its workloads on AWS), not just the upfront acquisition cost. <br />
            <b>- Agility: </b>
            in the world of cloud computing, "Agility" refers to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications that drive
            business growth. AWS provides a massive global cloud infrastructure that allows you to quickly innovate, experiment and iterate. Instead
            of waiting weeks or months for hardware, you can instantly deploy new applications. This ability is called Agility. <br />
            <b>- Elasticity: </b>
            <ul>
              <li>Refers to the ability to acquire resources as you need and release when they are no longer needed.</li>
              <li>Can also refer to the ability to scale computing resources OUT or IN easily, while only paying for the resources used.</li>
              <li>
                With elasticity, you do not have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need. You can provision only what you need, and then grow
                and shrink based on demand.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>- Reliability: </b> refers to the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, by dynamically acquiring
            computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions. <br />
            <b>- Scalability: </b> is the measurement of a system's ability to grow to accommodate an increase in demand, or shrink down to a
            diminishing demand. It provides consistent performance as a system handles growing workload requirements.<br />
            <b>- Important Global Services:</b> IAM, Route53, CloudFront, SNS and SES. <br />
            <b>- Right Sizing: </b> is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity. <br />
            <b>- AWS Infrastructure Event Management: </b> offers architecture guidance and operational support during the preparation and execution
            of planned events, such as shopping holidays, product launches, and migrations. It can also help assessing your operational readiness and
            identifying and mitigating risks. <br />
            <br />

            <b>SERVICES</b> <br />
            <b>- Resource Groups: </b> You can use resource groups to organize your AWS resources. Resource groups make it easier to manage and
            automate tasks on large numbers of resources at one time. <br />
            <b>- AWS Serverless Application Repository: </b> managed repository for serverless applications. Allows teams, businesses and individual
            developers to storage and share reusable applications and easily implement serverless application in a modern and powerful manner. Each
            application is packaged with an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template that define the resources needed in the AWS cloud. The
            publicly shared applications also include a link to the source code.<br />
            <b>- AWS Service Catalog: </b> AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for
            use on AWS. These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier
            application architectures. For example you can create a constraint for the deploy of EC2 instances so the users you choose to apply the
            constraint can only launch an instance when compliant. You can also hide options in the console allowing the user to only modify the
            options needed <br />
            <b>- AWS Acceptable Use Policy: </b> describes prohibited uses of the web srvices offered by Amazon. <br />
            <b>- Service Quotas: </b> enables you to view and manage your quotas for AWS services from a central location. Quotas, also referred to as
            limits in AWS, are the maximum values for the resources, actions, and items in your AWS account. Each AWS service defines its quotas and
            establishes default values for those quotas. <br />
            <b>- AWS Quick Starts: </b> are built by AWS solutions architects and partners to help you deploy popular technologies on AWS, based on
            AWS best practices for security and high availability. These accelerators reduce hundreds of manual procedures into just a few steps, so
            you can build your production environment quickly and start using it immediately. Each Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates
            that automate the deployment and a guide that discusses the architecture and provides step-by-step deployment instructions. <br />
            <b>- AWS Workspaces: </b> managed desktop as a service solution to easily provision Windows or Linux desktops. Pay as you go service with
            monthly or hourly rates. Secured data due to its integration with KMS. <br />
