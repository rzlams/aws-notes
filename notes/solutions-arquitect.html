            A user can belong to one or many groups<br />
            The policies define the permissions of the user, groups or roles<br />
            When a policy is attached to an individual user is called an inline policy<br />

            <b>How to manage AWS</b><br />
            AWS Console = UI accesible via web browser<br />
            AWS SDK = package that allow a programming language to communicate with AWS<br />
            AWS CLI = You need to install the AWS CLI and it allows you to do everything you can do in the web (AWS console).<br />
            AWS CloudShell = Is an AWS CLI that you can launch in the web browser (when you are logged in). You can upload and download files to your
            AWS PowerShell as if you are working in a machine<br />
            <br />
            <b>IAM Roles</b><br />
            They are used to assign permissions to AWS services in order to perform action on your behalf. A role can be used by either an IAM user in
            the same AWS account as the role or a user in a different AWS account. A role can also be used by a web service that AWS offers; a prime
            example is Amazon EC2.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Identities</b> <br />
            They are the IAM resource objects that are used to identify and group. You can attach a policy to an IAM identity. These include users,
            groups, and roles.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Entities</b> <br />
            They are the IAM resource objects that AWS uses for authentication. These include IAM users, federated users, and assumed IAM roles.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Principal</b> <br />
            It is a person or application that uses the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role to sign in and make requests to AWS. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Security Tools</b><br />
            IAM Credentials Report (account-level) = a report (excel) that lists all your account's users and the status of their various
            credentials<br />
            IAM Access Advisor (user-level) = shows the services permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed<br />

            <b>- Budget: </b> create budget and send alarms when costs (current or forecasted) exceed the budget. Allows you to set a limit to your
            bill. You can also set actions when the thresholds are exceeded. Budget could be of three types: usage, costs or reservation.<br />
            <br />
            - This services is considered Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). <br />
            - You can comunicate with an EC2 instance via SSH with your prefered SSH client or with the option "EC2 Instance Connect" in the console
            (web browser).<br />
            - The minimum charge for an EC2 instance is 60 seconds <br />
            <b>- Instance metadata: </b> is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance (even
            programatically). <br />
            <br />
            <b>- EC2 user data: </b> instance bootstraping script <br />
            <br />
            <b>Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</b><br />
            docker like images to be run in EC2 instances. The AMI must be in the same region as that of the EC2 instance to be launched. If the AMI
            exists in a different region, you can copy that AMI to the region where you want to launch the EC2 instance. The region of AMI has no
            bearing on the performance of the EC2 instance. You can create a new AMI from an existing EC2 instance.<br />
            <br />
            - EC2 Image Builder. Is a free service that help you to attach packages, roles and config other options to create a custom AMI.<br />
            <br />
            <b>EC2 instance types</b><br />
            - General porpuse: ideal for web servers. Good balance between compute, memory and networking.<br />
            - Compute optimized: great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors.<br />
            - Memory optimized: fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Security groups</b><br />
            - It is (kind of) a firewall that can be attached to any EC2 instance.<br />
            - It controls how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances. Can only contain ALLOW rules.<br />
            - You can attach several security groups to an EC2 instance.<br />
            - By default a security group deny any inbound traffick and allow any outbound traffic.<br />
            <br />
            <b>EC2 Purchasing options/Launch types</b><br />
            <b>- On-Demand: </b> pay as you go<br />
            <b>- Reserved: </b> (up to 70% discount) you commit to use the instance for one or three years with no, partial or all upfront payment:
            <ul>
              <li>Standard: you cannot change the type of instance</li>
              <li>Convertible: you can change the type of instance</li>
              <li>
                Scheduled: you reserved only a specific period of the day, week or month. This is not a valid response on the exam. AWS currently has
                this messages in its web: "You cannot purchase Scheduled Reserved Instances at this time".
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>- Spot: </b> the most cost-efficient (up to 90% discount). They use available resources of other instances thus they can be destroyed
            without prior notification.<br />
            <b>- Dedicated Instance: </b>hardware dedicated to your use but you don't have control over instance placement.<br />
            <b>- Dedicated Host: </b>physical server fully dedicated to your use. You need to commit for a 3 years period. Any question that talks
            about special licensing requirements refers to this instance type.<br />
